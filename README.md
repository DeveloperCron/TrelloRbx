# TrelloRbx Service

```text
TrelloRbx is a module that allows you to interact with Trello, send and get information
```

Currently under development but here some information why to use it:

## Why Should I use it over the simple way?

- TrelloRbx uses Promise in the methods. If the process has failed the promise will reject it and immediately warn you the exact reason it failed.

- No yielding, TrelloRbx designed simply not to yield your code.

- And last, TrelloService has a good way to avoid spam, etcetera.
